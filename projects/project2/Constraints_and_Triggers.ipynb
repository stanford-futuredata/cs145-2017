Furthermore, if a BEFORE trigger modifies or deletes a row, then it is undefined whether or not AFTER triggers that would have otherwise run on those rows will in fact run.\n",

    "Triggers are one of the unfortunate areas where SQL implementations differ greatly.  The correct semantics for a row-level “after” trigger, according to the SQL standard, is to activate the trigger after the entire triggering data modification statement completes, executing the trigger once for each modified row. PostgreSQL implements these semantics. SQLite instead implements semantics where the trigger is activated immediately after each row-level change, interleaving trigger execution with execution of the modification statement.\n",
