    "* You will need to install the `prettytable` module to run the scripts. (eg. `pip install --user prettytable`)\n",
    "* Download `flights.db` from http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs145/files/flights.db and make sure it is in the same directory as this Jupyter notebook \n",
    "* Run the top cell above to load the database `flights.db`.\n",
    "* You **may** create new Jupyter notebook cells to use for e.g. testing, debugging, exploring, etc.- this is encouraged in fact!\n",
    "* When you see `In [*]:` to the left of the cell you are executing, this means that the code / query is _running_.\n",
    "    * **If the cell is hanging- i.e. running for too long: to restart the SQL connection, you must restart the entire python kernel**\n",
    "    * To restart the kernel using the menu bar: \"Kernel >> Restart & Clear Output\"), then re-execute the sql connection cell at the top\n",
    "    * You will also need to restart the connection if you want to load a different version of the database file\n",
    "* Remember:\n",
    "    * `%sql [SQL]` is for _single line_ SQL queries\n",
    "    * `%%sql \n",
    "    [SQL]` is for _multi line_ SQL queries\n",
    "* Running `submit.py` will run the queries and print them. \n",
    "* We have provided correct output from our solution in `correct_output.txt`.\n",
    "  * You can diff your output with the correct output by running `python sanity_check.py` or `python submit.py > my_output; diff my_output correct_output.txt`\n",
    "   * **Your `submit.py` should match this output exactly.** This means:\n",
    "       * the columns should have the **same names** as `correct_output.txt`\n",
    "       * the columns should be in the **same order** as `correct_output.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions:\n",
    " * Do _NOT_ submit your iPython notebook.\n",
    " * Instead, copy each query into the provided `submit.py` script in the corresponding variable.\n",
    "   * Do _not_ copy the `%sql` or `%%sql` commands, only the raw SQL.\n",
    "   * We will autograde your queries on a database with identical schema but arbitrarily-chosen values. Therefore, do not hard-code any constants in your queries -- all of your queries should use the tables in the database.\n",
    " * **Follow the instructions in `submission_instructions.txt` to upload your answers to our autograders.**\n",
